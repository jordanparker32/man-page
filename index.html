        <div class="man__section">As we progress as a society, we continue to connect more and more things to the internet. With each new connection, we potentially open ourselves to the threat of someone hacking into the new device and exploiting it in any way possible.</div>
        <div class="man__section">As a Senior at the University of Southern Mississippi, I am pursuing a degree in IT Development with a minor in Network Security. With this degree, I plan to go into a career in the Cyber Security field to combat those who would use internet connected devices for harm.</div>

              <div class="flag__section">
                For our Software Engineering I course, we were grouped together and asked to come up with a project that could be marketed. We came up with the MyBanana project as we are all fairly active and wanted a better way to track nutrition. Most applications come bundled as an all-in-one solution to fitness and nutrition tracking, but they end up being quite bloated by the end. We wanted to create a simple application that would server severaly purposes.
              </div>

              <div class="flag__section">
                The first reason is to address bloated fitness apps. We wanted something simple but still highly functional. We chose potassium and water as the main nutrient tackers as they are the main compounds needed for adequate muscle functioning. The second reason we made this app is to address the obesity epidemic in Mississippi. We wanted to create a fun and inviting user interface that would attract people that do not have any health or fitness knowledge, and give them an easy step in the direction of better health. Which is another reason why we chose to keep its simple with water and potassium. Switching from sugary beverages to water can elimanate a large portion of sugar in a persons diet leading to a plethora of health benefits.

                led front-end development, working with fellow officers and members of both our ACM and IEEE student branches to build our website. Along with this, I worked to create other <a href="graphic_design/graphic.html">Promotional Material</a> to reach a wider audience. On average, we increased our weekly meeting attendance by over 130% and tripled our attendence of LAN Events.

                As a final project for Dynamic Web Development, we grouped together to come up with a simple project that would include both a front-end and back-end. My partner and I decided to create a landing page for Southern Miss students to easily access their most used files. The student would be able to log in and configure web app link buttons to their personal want. For this project the front end was built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery using no frameworks, and using PHP to call to the server that was made using MySQL.

              <div class="flag__section">I was re-elected to be the president of USM-ACM as well as USM-IEEE for the academic year of 2019 to 2020. Using skills I learned from the mistakes made the previous year, I implemented several things. First, I understood what being a project manager meant. Instead of trying to do everything myself, I learned to delegate out to my executives of both organizations and plan projects with them. Secondly, I learned how to manage my time more effeciently.</div>
